# 100 Days of Code

### Day 1 :<br>
<i><b>This problem was recently asked by Google.</i></b><br>
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.<br>
There are two solutions provided- the Method 1 was naive method and Method 2 was more efficient method<br>

### Day 2 :<br>
 The <i><b>Sieve of Eratosthenes </b></i>is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than N.
   The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.
   For example, to find all primes less than 100, we would first mark [4, 6, 8, ...] (multiples of two),
   then [6, 9, 12, ...] (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than N,
   the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.
   Implement this algorithm.<br>

### Day 3:<br>
<b><i>This problem was asked by Spotify.</b></i><br>
There are N couples sitting in a row of length 2 * N. They are currently ordered randomly,
   but would like to rearrange themselves so that each couple's partners can sit side by side.
   What is the minimum number of swaps necessary for this to happen?

### Day 4 :<br>
<b><i>This problem was asked by Uber.</i></b><br>
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.<br>
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
Follow-up: what if you can't use division?<br>

### Day 5 :<br>
<b><i>This problem was asked by Google.</b></i><br>
Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, 
and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

#### Day 6 :<br>
<b><i>This problem was asked by Stripe.</b></i><br>
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array.
The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
You can modify the input array in-place.

#### Day 7:<br>
Given a string with repeated characters, rearrange the string so that no two adjacent characters are the same.
If this is not possible, return None.For example, given "aaabbc", you could return "ababac". Given "aaab", return None.
